        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hi my name is Sam, I am 27 born and raised in OK- attening the full Software Development track through <a href="https://www.nucamp.co/"><strong>Nucamp</strong>.</p></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Born/Living In: Stillwater, Oklahoma</li>
            <li>A memorable moment in my life: Climbing at "The Shredding" (Redding, CA) for my 25th birthday. <br />
                <img src="images/climbing_crack.jpg" alt="Photo of myself climbing a 'crack climb', I am jamming my shoulder into the opening to hold a rock inside it while I reposition my feet"/></li>
            <li>A life goal: To live on and own a ranch.</li>
            <li>A career goal: I want to have a job that I can do remotely whatever it is because I value my personal time and freedom above all else. My first professional endeavor was to be a full-time artist so that is still very important to me though it will most likely not be consuming a full-time position currently.</li>
            <li>Fun fact: I have a dog named Spoon. <br /> 
            <p>Here he is as a <strong>puppy</strong> vs <strong>now</strong>:</p><img src="images/spoon_side_eye.jpg" alt="Photo of my dog spoon as a puppy, he is side eyeing the camera while sitting on my lap" width="300"/> <img src="images/spoon_hug.jpg" alt="Photo of my dog as an adult, we are laying on the couch together and I'm hugging his neck" width="300"/></li> <br /> <p>And here's a video of puppy Spoon for the hell of it:</p><video src="videos/spoon_video.MP4" controls muted loop height="500"> Your browser does not support HTML5 video.

        <h2>My Art</h2>
        <p>I have considered myself a fulltime artist for most of my adult life, over the years I've worked in many different mediums but I am particularly enamoured by drawing and sculpture as well as film and digital art. Below are some examples of my work from my time in my bachelor's. If you would like to see more current work as well as keep up with me as I take on coding- click the "My Insta" link at the bottom of the page. Feel free to browse each platform I post on!</p><br />
